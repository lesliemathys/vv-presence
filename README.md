# vv-presence

The idea for this project came from a [reply](https://twitter.com/0xlght/status/1527776487201558528?s=20&t=FWWbsmnnYwjCdYoTCYASNA) to a Jack Butcher [tweet](https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1527774947413721089?s=20&t=FWWbsmnnYwjCdYoTCYASNA).

Inspired by [Sunday FM](sunday.fm), this website will play an endless loop of white noise, encouraging listeners to be present.

## Approach
I wanted to emulate the simple layout of Sunday FM. But use the Visualize Value font family and black and white palette. 

At the time of creating this project, I am approx. 60% through the Foundation section of [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com). Using my knowledge of basic HTML and CSS styling and Flexbox, along with some additional internet searching, I have been able to create this project.
